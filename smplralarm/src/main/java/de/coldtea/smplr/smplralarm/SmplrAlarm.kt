/**
 * API interface for setting an alarm.
 * This function requires proper setup to execute different alarm notifications.
 * It accepts both obligatory and optional parameters which explained below, and
 * based on the combination of which, this function is able to set an alarm which
 * serves different purposes. This call returns a request code which serves as an unique
 * identifier for the alarm set. This id can be used later for cancellation and updates
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * Constructor arguments :
 * - context : It is allowed to send any kind of context, but it is preferable to send application context to make sure alarm works when the application is not active
 *
 * Obligatory arguments:
 * - hour : Hour of the day in 24h format.
 * - min : Minute of the hour.
 *
 * Optional arguments which will be substituted with dummy items
 * - alarmNotification: A data item which contains the data which will be used in course of action to create an Android Notification. For more detail please check out the API interface of the same name
 * - channel: A data item which contains the data which will be used in course of action to create an Android Notification Channel. For more detailed information please check out the API interface of the same name
 *
 * Optional arguments
 * - requestAPI: API interface to listen the changes on the database. It returns the list of the alarms in JSON format. For more detailed information please check out --> SmplrAlarmListRequestAPI
 * - weekdays: the days of the week on which the alarm is active. An alarm without this argument set rings only once, other alarms however, repeats until they are canceled. To set this parameter the enum class WeekDays must be used.
 * - isActive: state of the alarm which indicates whether alarm is active or not
 * - intent: The intent which is executed when the notification is tapped.
 * - receiverIntent: The intent which is executed when the alarm goes off.
